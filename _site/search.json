    "text": "4.1 Some of my research work with R\nFor example, my research passion is the social determinants of health. I made a quick example of how my research would look like to showcase the type of career path I want to go into.\n###Brief description and methodology of research project\nMy research project involves utilizing a publicly available Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) database to extract relevant variables and find the relationship between them through statistical analyses. For example, in the 2021 Full Year Consolidated file in MEPS, there are variables that measure the social determinants of health, perceived mental health, and demographic information such as sex and race.\nOut of the numerous variables, I make a new database with only the variables of interest using R. In this mini research project I am able to showcase, I only included social determinants of health factors that measure an individual’s social support.\nHere are the variables I used: “DUPERSID”, “SDCHURCH”, “SDCOMM”, “SDCOMPAN”, “SDFAMILY”, “SDFRIENDS”, “SDGETTGT”, “MNHLTH31”, “SEX”, “RACETHX”.\nThe name of “MNHTLH31” was changed to “Perceived_Mental_Health” to make it more intuitive in my dataframe, and I added a new column “Social_Support_Sum” that takes all SDOH variables and sums up the numbers into the column. The less the number, the less social support they have.\nTo explore more about data collection method and genreal decription of MEPS, click here: 2021 Consolidated Full Year File document\nTo learn more about the variables, click here: 2021 Consolidated Full Year File codebook\n###Research using R\nHere is how my RStudio screen would look like.\n\n#|label: source-Rscript\n\nsource(\"student-sunny-data.R\")\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'psych'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:scales':\n\n    alpha, rescale\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    %+%, alpha\n\n\nLoading required package: Matrix\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Matrix'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    expand, pack, unpack\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'kableExtra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    group_rows\n\n\nSuggested APA citation: Thériault, R.

    "text": "Mark an objective attempt for any learning objectives you believe you have demonstrated in this assignment.\nMark when an objective attempt should count toward the 20 unique objectives requirement. If your attempt is successful, your grader will mark the standard as met on your objective-tracker document.\nBelow each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the “parse and define functions and arguments” objective, even if it is only used in one context.\n\n\n\nCreate and maintain a repo with sensible organization and naming conventions\n\nAll folder and file names are informative\nUses relative paths correctly\nDoes not have
