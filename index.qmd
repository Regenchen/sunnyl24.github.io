# Introduction

Welcome to my website. This site documents my life as a college student at UChicago. This is the most authentic and only chance you will get to learn about the real side of me. Get excited!

# Childhood

Not invited to analyze my childhood Freudian style, but it helps to understand what kind of person I am.

# Family and friends

As a huge extrovert, family and friends are an important part of my life. People listed on here are my rock and the source of energy in my life, so...it's a pretty important section.

# Student Sunny

I love school. Not that I'm a nerd. Does that make me a nerd? Perhaps. But intellectual stimulation is a core part of my life. It keeps me going. As Bill Gates once said, "I don't want my brain to stop working." Gates and I have this in common. My greatest fear is not being able to think. In true Descartes spirit, I think, therefore I exist or *cogito ergo sum*.

For example, my research passion is the **social determinants of health**. I made a quick example of how my research would look like to showcase the type of career path I want to go into.
