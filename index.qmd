# Introduction

Welcome to my website. This site documents my life as a college student at UChicago. This is the most authentic and only chance you will get to learn about the real side of me. Get excited!
There will be a brief overview of my [childhood](#sec-childhood), [familiy and friends](#sec-family-and-friends), academic passions (#sec-student-sunny), and other parts of my life (#sec-other). 

# Childhood {#sec-childhood}

Not invited to analyze my childhood Freudian style, but it helps to understand what kind of person I am.

# Family and friends {#sec-family-and-friends}

As a huge extrovert, family and friends are an important part of my life. People listed on here are my rock and the source of energy in my life, so...it's a pretty important section.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="My parents and I at grad"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/parents.jpg")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="At our favorite boba place in Irvine with my brother Ray"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/my-brother.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="My dog Songyee"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/my-dog.jpeg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="High school senior trip with my best friends"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/high-school-friends.jpeg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="At the 2025 MODA Fashion show with my friends"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/MODA-fashion-show.jpeg")
```

# Student Sunny {#sec-student-sunny}

I love school. Not that I'm a nerd. But intellectual stimulation is a core part of my life. It keeps me going. As Bill Gates once said, "I don't want my brain to stop working." Gates and I have this in common. My greatest fear is not being able to think. In true Descartes spirit, I think, therefore I exist or *cogito ergo sum*.

I go to the University of Chicago, and I am a pre-med student majoring in Biology and Comparative Human Development. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="UChicago orientation"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/uchicago-walk.jpeg")
```

Confused what a **comparative human development** major is? You can find out here: 
```{r}
#| label: A link to learn about my major

knitr::asis_output('[Department of Comparative Human Development](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/)')
```

## Some of my research work with R
For example, my research passion is the **social determinants of health**. I made a quick example of how my research would look like to showcase the type of career path I want to go into.  

###Brief description and methodology of research project

My research project involves utilizing a publicly available Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) database to extract relevant variables and find the relationship between them through statistical analyses. For example, in the 2021 Full Year Consolidated file in MEPS, there are variables that measure the social determinants of health, perceived mental health, and demographic information such as sex and race. 

Out of the numerous variables, I make a new database with only the variables of interest using R. In this mini research project I am able to showcase, I only included social determinants of health factors that measure an individual's social support. 

Here are the variables I used:  "DUPERSID", "SDCHURCH", "SDCOMM", "SDCOMPAN", "SDFAMILY", "SDFRIENDS", "SDGETTGT", "MNHLTH31", "SEX", "RACETHX". 

The name of "MNHTLH31" was changed to "Perceived_Mental_Health" to make it more intuitive in my dataframe, and I added a new column "Social_Support_Sum" that takes all SDOH variables and sums up the numbers into the column. The less the number, the less social support they have. 

To explore more about data collection method and genreal decription of MEPS, click here: [2021 Consolidated Full Year File document](data/h233doc.pdf)

###Research using R

Here is how my RStudio screen would look like.

```{r}
#|label: source-Rscript

source("student-sunny-data.R")

```

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

# Load necessary libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(scales) # squishing scales (and other outlier handling)
library(psych) # common analyses and visualizations in psychology
library(stats) # basic statistics
library(lme4) # mixed models
library(patchwork) # "stitch" together multiple plots
library(kableExtra) # nice tables (and migraines)
library(rempsyc) # imperfect APA tables
library(flextable) # yet another APA table option
```

```{r}
#| label: analysis-preferences
#| include: false

# Seed for random number generation
set.seed(42)

# Set global chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  cache.extra = knitr::rand_seed,
  fig.height = 6,
	fig.width = 7,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE,
	comment = ""
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: make-long-data 
#| include: false 

h233_categorized.long <- h233_categorized %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Perceived_Mental_Health, Social_Support_Sum), names_to = "ivanddv") 
```

```{r}
#| label: apa-ready-table
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics"

# Produce the table as an APA formatted table with rempsyc

h233_categorized.long %>% 
  group_by(ivanddv) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(value),
         median = median(value),
         sd = sd(value),
         min = min(value),
         max = max(value),
         range = max-min,
         range = diff(range(value))
  ) %>% nice_table()

```

### Summary, statistics of samples

```{r}
#| label: frequency-tables-sex
#| #| tbl-cap: "Sex frequency table"

sex_table <- as.data.frame(table(h233_categorized$SEX))
colnames(sex_table) <- c("Sex", "Count")
print(sex_table, row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| label: frequency-tables-race
#| #| tbl-cap: "Race frequency table"

race_table <- as.data.frame(table(h233_categorized$RACETHX))
colnames(race_table) <- c("Race", "Count")
print(race_table, row.names = FALSE)

h233_categorized
```

```{r}
#|label: bar-plot

# dplyr package has filter() function
library(dplyr)

# Define factor labels
mental_health_labels <- c("1" = "Excellent", 
                          "2" = "Very Good", 
                          "3" = "Good", 
                          "4" = "Fair", 
                          "5" = "Poor")

# Filter out invalid values and recode as factors
h233_filtered <- h233_categorized %>%
  filter(Perceived_Mental_Health %in% 1:5) %>%
  mutate(Perceived_Mental_Health = factor(Perceived_Mental_Health, 
                                          levels = 1:5, 
                                          labels = mental_health_labels))

# Load necessary package to make bar graph
library(ggplot2)

# Create the plot
ggplot(h233_filtered, aes(x = Perceived_Mental_Health)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Perceived Mental Health", 
       x = "Perceived Mental Health Measure", 
       y = "Count", 
       caption = "MNHLTH31 variables used") +
  theme_minimal()
```
From this bar graph, we can see that the distribution of perceived mental health in individuals is more positive than negative.
