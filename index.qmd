# Introduction

Welcome to my website. This site documents my life as a college student at UChicago. This is the most authentic and only chance you will get to learn about the real side of me. Get excited!

# Childhood

Not invited to analyze my childhood Freudian style, but it helps to understand what kind of person I am.

# Family and friends

As a huge extrovert, family and friends are an important part of my life. People listed on here are my rock and the source of energy in my life, so...it's a pretty important section.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="My parents and I at grad"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/parents.jpg")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="At our favorite boba place in Irvine with my brother Ray"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/my-brother.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="My dog Songyee"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/my-dog.jpeg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="High school senior trip with my best friends"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/high-school-friends.jpeg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="At the 2025 MODA Fashion show with my friends"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/MODA-fashion-show.jpeg")
```

# Student Sunny

I love school. Not that I'm a nerd. But intellectual stimulation is a core part of my life. It keeps me going. As Bill Gates once said, "I don't want my brain to stop working." Gates and I have this in common. My greatest fear is not being able to think. In true Descartes spirit, I think, therefore I exist or *cogito ergo sum*.

I go to the University of Chicago, and I am a pre-med student majoring in Biology and Comparative Human Development. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="UChicago orientation"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/uchicago-walk.jpeg")
```

Confused what a **comparative human development** major is? You can find out here: 
```{r}
#| label: A link to learn about my major
#| echo: false 

knitr::asis_output('[Department of Comparative Human Development](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/)')
```

## Some of my research work with R
For example, my research passion is the **social determinants of health**. I made a quick example of how my research would look like to showcase the type of career path I want to go into.  

Here is how my RStudio screen would look like.

```{r}
#|label: source-Rscript

source("student-sunny-data.R")
```

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

# Load necessary libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(scales) # squishing scales (and other outlier handling)
library(psych) # common analyses and visualizations in psychology
library(stats) # basic statistics
library(lme4) # mixed models
library(patchwork) # "stitch" together multiple plots
library(kableExtra) # nice tables (and migraines)
library(rempsyc) # imperfect APA tables
library(flextable) # yet another APA table option
```

```{r}
#| label: analysis-preferences
#| include: false

# Seed for random number generation
set.seed(42)

# Set global chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  cache.extra = knitr::rand_seed,
  fig.height = 6,
	fig.width = 7,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE,
	comment = ""
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: make-long-data 
#| include: false 

h233_categorized.long <- h233_categorized %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Perceived_Mental_Health, Social_Support_Sum), names_to = "ivanddv") 
```

```{r}
#| label: apa-ready-table
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics"

# Produce the table as an APA formatted table with rempsyc

h233_categorized.long %>% 
  group_by(ivanddv) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(value),
         median = median(value),
         sd = sd(value),
         min = min(value),
         max = max(value),
         range = max-min,
         range = diff(range(value))
  ) %>% nice_table()

```

```{r}
#|label:
h233_categorized


```

# Other passions and quirks

Yogi, foodie, #trackstar, dog mom, neat freak, and more

```{r}
#| label: New things
