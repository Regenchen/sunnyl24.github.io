## What is this project?

This project is a mini-project for my d2mr class. I am making a website through Github pages that allows users to learn about me. 
It investigates the different aspects of my life. My family and friends, childhood, academic life, and other non-academic passions. 

## Repo organization 

### Folders 

There are three folders in this repo. 
1. Every image I used in the website
[images](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/images) 
2. Files necessary for the rendering of my website
[index_files](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/index_files) 
3. All data necessary for explaining my current passion research project
[data](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/data) 
4. This folder got automatically made while rendering website
[_site](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/_site)

### Other informational docs 

For Natalie and Yuchen ❤️❤️❤️:
[assessment.md](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/assessment.md)

The document we are currently in. You can see the organization of the repository: 
[README.md](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/README.md)

### R scripts 

[student-sunny-data.R](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/student-sunny-data.R)
R scripts help keep an organized final .qmd document that has relevant information for rendering a website. 
I kept the data wrangling codes all in my R script, which allowed me to simply source the R script in my main markdown document. 

### git.ignore 

[.gitignore](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/.gitignore)
This file has files or materials that don't need to be tracked by git because they're too big or not needed anymore in my documents. 
It helps improves performance by ignoring large files and maintains a clean, organized repo. 

## My website 

Here is the website that this repo is used for: [Final Product Website](https://sunnyl24.github.io/)

### Website structure 

#### Introduction

Hyperlinks other sections, so you can more easily flip through.

#### Childhood

Click through the different tabs to see some fun facts about my earlier life, and see some baby pictures! 

#### Family and friends 

You can flip through pictures of my loved ones. 
Mom, dad, brother, friends...

#### Student Sunny 

Run through of how my current reserach methodology looks like. It's not presentation of my actual research project, but it's a demo that shows what database I work with, and how my workflow is. 

#### Other passions and quirks 

More pictures, links, a photo gallery of my dog 

#### That's it! 

Just one concluding remark.
