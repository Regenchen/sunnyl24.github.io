## What is this project?
This project is a mini-project for my d2mr class. I am making a website through Github pages that allows users to learn about me. 
It investigates the different aspects of my life. My family and friends, childhood, academic life, and personal life such as passions. 

## Repo organization

### Files to help render the website 

Main .qmd document that is translated to the website: 
[index.qmd](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/index.qmd)

Other documents for rendering: 
[_quarto.yml](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/_quarto.yml)

Created when rendering:
[index.html](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/index.html)
[index.tex](https://github.com/sunnyl24/sunnyl24.github.io/tree/main/index.tex)

### R scripts 

R scripts help keep an organized final .qmd document that has relevant information for rendering a website. 
I kept the data wrangling codes all in my R script, which allowed me to simply source the R script in my main markdown document. 

### git.ignore 

This file has files or materials that don't need to be tracked by git because they're too big or not needed anymore in my documents. 
It helps improves performance by ignoring large files and maintains a clean, organized repo.
